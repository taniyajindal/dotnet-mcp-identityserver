## üíª Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for classes, methods, and properties; camelCase for variables
- **Documentation**: Add XML comments for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception handling and logging
- **Configuration**: Use the configuration system for settings
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive data like API keys or passwords

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Controllers**: Keep controllers thin, delegate business logic to services
- **Services**: Implement interfaces for testability
- **Dependencies**: Use dependency injection consistently
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- **Authentication**: Ensure all endpoints are properly secured

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: Test business logic in services
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and authentication flows
- **Test Data**: Use realistic but non-sensitive test data
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies appropriately
